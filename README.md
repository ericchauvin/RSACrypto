If you are new to doing math with large integers you should see the Base10Number.cs file first, and then read some of the notes in the Integer.cs file.  And see the IntegerMath.cs file too.

This RSA Crypto project is about doing math efficiently with large integers.  It's about making interesting algorithms for working with large integers.  

As far as I know I invented the Modular Reduction algorithm that is in the ModularReduction.cs file.

I'm not sure how to cite references for basic arithmetic.  I mean should I cite the book Liber Abaci, from the year 1202?  Or Donald Knuths classic books from the 1960s?  Or my third grade arithmetic teacher?

One of the articles that helped me to understand division was: Brinch Hansen, Multiple-Length Division Revisited, 1994
